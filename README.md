# Retrain_Program

Clone the repository.
Create a branch using your username. This is your branch.
Run some Test Cases. Test case commit message has to follow the pattern "TC{number of case} <<username>>"

Test cases to run:

1) Create a new file <<username>>.txt and add it to the repository. 'U' is the ref. to this file.
   Create a new file <<warehouse>>.txt and add it to the repository. 'W' is the ref. to this file.
2) Add a fake email in the the 'U' file.
3) Add a fake address in the 'W' file.
5) Add your village in the 'U' file.
6) Create a file local<<username>>.txt and keep it out of versioning.
7) Merge self_study branch to your branch. Resolve conflicts( Keep ORIGIN address. yours is fake...)
8) Revert the 5th case.

* Spend some time to test your unstaging skills.
** Any case should be pushed to the remote repository (Stage, Commit, Push).
*** At the end, use Github to create a Merge request to the master.
