# Retrain_Program

Clone the repository.
Create a branch using your username. This is your branch.
Run some Test Cases. Test case commit message has to follow the pattern "TC{number of case} << username >>"

Test cases to run:

1) Create a new file << username >>.txt and add it to the repository. 'U' is the ref. to this file.
   Create a new file << warehouse >>.txt and add it to the repository. 'W' is the ref. to this file.
2) Add a fake email in the the 'U' file.
3) Add a fake address in the 'W' file.
5) Add your village in the 'U' file.
6) Create a file local<< username >>.txt and keep it out of versioning.
7) Merge self_study branch to your branch. Resolve conflicts( Keep ORIGIN address. yours is fake...)
8) Revert the 5th case.
9) Checkout to the commit of the 2nd case. Add your favorite drink in the second line of 'U' file.
   Commit the changes to a new branch with name temp< username >.txt.
10) Merge the new branch to your branch.

* Spend some time to test your unstaging skills (reset, checkout).
** Any case should be pushed to the remote repository (Stage, Commit, Push).
*** At the end, use Github to create a Merge request to the master.
